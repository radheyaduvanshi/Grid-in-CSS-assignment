In CSS Grid Layout, the grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns properties are used to define the size of automatically created rows and columns within a grid container. 
These properties are particularly useful when the number of rows or columns generated by the grid is not explicitly defined in the CSS code but is determined by 
the content being placed in the grid. They help in controlling the size of these implicit grid tracks.

Grid-auto-rows:

This property is used to specify the size of automatically generated rows in a grid container when new rows are created to accommodate grid items that don't 
explicitly fit within the defined rows.You can set the value of grid-auto-rows to a specific length, such as pixels or percentages, or you can use relative units 
like fr (fraction of available space) to distribute available space among these auto-generated rows.


Grid-auto-columns:

Similar to grid-auto-rows, this property allows you to specify the size of automatically created columns when grid items are placed outside the explicitly defined columns.
You can use grid-auto-columns to set the width of these auto-generated columns.
