Justify-items and justify-self are CSS properties used to control the alignment of items within a grid or a flex container. However, they work at different levels and 
serve different purposes:

Justify-items:
justify-items is used to align all the items (grid items or flex items) within a container along the inline axis (the direction in which text flows, usually horizontal).
It is applied to the container (the parent element), and it sets the alignment for all the items inside that container.
It accepts values like start, end, center, stretch, etc.which determine how items should be aligned within the container along the inline axis.

Justify-self:
Justify-self is used to align an individual grid item or flex item within a container. It allows you to control the alignment of a specific item within the container.
It is applied to the individual item, and it overrides the alignment set by justify-items on the container for that specific item.
Like justify-items, it also accepts values like start, end, center, stretch, etc. to determine how the specific item should be aligned along the inline axis.
